<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Here I will discuss my matchbox replica project, which introduced me to 3D Printing!</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Guidlines</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>The guidelines for this project were straightforward. We were expected to create a 3D model and print a 3D matchbox car to scale. We tried to keep the X, Y, and Z measures at a 1:1 Scale of our model matchbox car. I used websites such as Onshape and Cura, to help create and print my model car.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Process</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>The process for this project was very important, every step needed to be precise and correct. My first focus was the Drawing. I chose a small matchbox sports car. I used a vernier caliper to exactly measure all 3 dimensions of the car. I then took pictures of my engineering drawing and uploaded them to Onshape. I had to 3D model and use my dimension engineering drawing to coordinate the size and shape of the car. I then used the extrusion tool to remove negative space to give me the raw exterior of the car. I then added small details such as wheels and a spoiler. I then exported it as an STL file and brought the file into Cura, so I could finally print my car! I had to add supports to my car to ensure for a successful print. I then exported it as a GCODE file and chose a dark blue color for its color.</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Setbacks and Solutions</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>This was one of the most fun and challenging projects yet. I faced — setbacks and solutions throughout the design process. I struggled with transferring my dimension sketch into Onshape, and fitting the right dimensions on the rectangle. I ended up having to remeasure all three dimensions again to have them fit on the box. I also struggled with creating wheels on my car. I decided to go with a different wheel style than everyone else. I made my car a low rider, and decided to show only half of the wheels, creating a retro look.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that was the highlight of my design and a great solution to one of my obstacles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></span></p>
